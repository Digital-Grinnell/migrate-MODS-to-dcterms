# Migration Workflow - Start to Finish

This document needs the following...

  - Document the setup and execution of the `drush -u 1 iduF islandora_datastream_export...` command.  
    - Include destination paths and other details.  
  - Document best means of moving files into place for subsequent steps, presumably `aws S3` commands.
  - Document the use of this project repo to generate a `.csv`.
  - Document the Alma portion of the import process in detail.
